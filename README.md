# Csgo-Switcher
A tool used to switch and play music and sounds in Counter Strike:Global Offensive

How to make ready for first use:

1 - Open up the console in Csgo and type in the following bind: bind yourwishedkey "toggle voice_loopback 0 1;toggle voice_inputfromfile 0 1;+voicerecord"
  Note: yourwishedkey must be a valid key like: Q,W,E,R or KP_PLUS and so on.
  
2 - Open up the Switcher Program and select your music folder and your sound folder. You need to convert your songs first by simply dragging and dropping them on the application. Those converted files need to go in the music or the sound folder.

Note: The program lets you have two different folder paths where you can actually put your converted .wav files to. One folder is for sounds, which are accesible to hotkey presses, and the other one is for music to shuffle trough with your arrow keys ingame.

3 - Select your main Csgo folder. Its the folder under Program Files - Steam - SteamApps - common - CounterStrikeGlobalOffensive
      * It is called Counter-Strike Global Offensive

4 - How to actually use ingame:
  Bind some Keys in the program first to switch between songs or use left and right arrow to navigate through your selected folder.
  
  Press the key u binded in step [1], and there you go, your song is playing. To switch it just navigate with the left and right arrow keys, to swap between songs under the random folder, or use your hotkey to switch them.
  
  When the song ends or you need to stop it mid way just press the key from step [1] again. Also make sure to press your voice key to stop posting in voice chat.
